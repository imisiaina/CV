I am a conscientious, ambitious and aspiring **Web-Developer**. Although a Biomedical Science graduate I developed a keen interest in programming and was especially fascinated with the life-cycle of websites and idea of being a able to bring a website to life from start to finish. 

I am tenacious and determined to follow a course of action - to achieve objectives. I am a clear thinker with an inner need to be objective and analytical.

Currently, I am looking for a suitable entry level software developer position with a fast paced and ambitious company that can offer development training, project-based learning and has on-going programs designed to nature, develop and promote individuals to their maximum potential.

**Tech Proficiencies**: Ruby (Sinatra, Rspec) - Javascript (Jest, Node.js, React) - HTML - CSS - Cypress - SQL (PostgreSQL) - MongoDB
