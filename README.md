I am a conscientious, ambitious and aspiring **Web-Developer**. Although a Biomedical Science graduate I developed a keen interest in programming and was especially fascinated with the life-cycle of websites and idea of being a able to bring a website to life from start to finish. 

I am tenacious and determined to follow a course of action - to achieve objectives. I am a clear thinker with an inner need to be objective and analytical.

Currently, I am looking for a suitable entry level software developer position with a fast paced and ambitious company that can offer development training, project-based learning and has on-going programs designed to nature, develop and promote individuals to their maximum potential.

## Skills

**Teamwork** 
- As part of the tech team for concerts I am responsible for projection and camera mixing, which involves communication across teams of people. Good communication and teamwork allows me to work well in a cross functional team all working on different things in order to come together to deliver exceptional software.
- As part of my Duke of Edinburgh Award (Bronze & Silver) – worked as part of a team to follow instructions and navigate through a set path. I was given the role of mapping the groups’ locations and figuring out where next to go.

**Quick to adapt** 
- During one of the projects for Makers, I was given a codebase that had been started, in a tech stack I had little knowledge on. This demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt quickly and was able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently, resulting in a minimum viable product that I was able to showcase. 

**Analytical Thinker and Problem Solver** 
- Was able to solve issues in the codebase for my final project which helped the team and ensured we met our deadline.

**Attention to detail** 
- From video editing and videography, I have developed a keen eye for finer details. This is shown in my coding, where I can see how the whole code fits together aswell as finding bugs during debugging.

## Work Experience

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2022 - December 2022)
- Started a course on web-development through Makers in which I learnt various tools needed to gain entry into the Tech sector through directed learning and group projects using various methodologies and frameworks including:
- Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails 
- JavaScript
- RSpec, Jest

#### Coventry University (September 2016 - January 2020)

- Biomedical Science
- Completed 21 modules including Human Physiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology and a Microbiology final year project: The effect of environmental stresses on the growth of E. coli and its antibiotic susceptibility to antibiotics. The purpose was to understand the growth of E. coli, if this growth was affected by heat and pH; and whether this affected how susceptible E. coli was to different antibiotics. 

Excellent IT skills with advanced Microsoft Office knowledge – BCS certified Level 3 Spreadsheet Software (ECDL)

#### Beth's Grammar School for Boys

- A levels in Biology, Psychology and Economics
- Duke of Edinburgh Award (Bronze & Silver) – worked as part of a team to follow instructions and navigate through a set path. I was given the role of mapping the groups’ locations and figuring out where next to go.

## Hobbies

- Gaming: I enjoy playing games and is a major reason for my passion in IT and technology
